snip_11_word_of_mouth

NOTE: How this plays out
- Jake Hyde, Freya and General Fletcher are at an arms trade show stand that is showing off the guassian enhanced rail gun
- they bicker about why they're there until the saleman spots Fletcher
- Fletcher introduces Dr. Hyde and him and the salesman have an argument (that Hyde has clearly thought out before hand) about which is
more important: the weapon or the soldier who wields it?
- This ends up in the salesman asking Freya to try it out
- she does so and puts in a time to take down the range targets that is very good (it's like a smaller version of "the pit" from COD)
- the salesman patronises her a little thinking shes just the officers PA
- she then asks if she can compare it against her standard issue silenced pistol
- the sales guy agrees and she, calling upon Agrona (her A.I. counterpart) to take control and use the CNT enhanced clothing she's wearing to complete
the course in rapid time while dodging fire she had to take cover from on the previous run.
- afterwards she turns to the sales rep and says "I think i'm good with just this thanks."

"Supreme Leader Yenis! Step right up son, I have something your security detail would love for their arsenal!
And Brigadier General Kurtz, your Kommandos would agree this new weapon platform is wunderbar! Jiang Xenbo..."

While the enthusiastic yank in what may have once been a correctly tailored suit was drawing an assortment of top brass
as he went into excruciating detail over the bulky and stubby assault rifle, Freya at the back leant against the pile of sandbags wishing
she was back at the hotel rather than baking in the forty degree Kuwaiti heat.
