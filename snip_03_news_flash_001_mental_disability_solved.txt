HEADLINE: MENTAL DISABILITY SOLVED USING A THIRD BRAIN?!? Pay Â£0.49 to read more.

Serapis Inc. , the A.I. giant, revealed details of a successful clinical trial at 10:30:54 this morning.
After filing for FDA approval last November to run tests of the companies' latest generation personal A.I, Alice,
for use in treating mental disorders the corporation has finally broken the radio silence on the project. //despite?

Serapis has been in development for the last 5 years of what they have dubbed "the future of thought", a vision for running
a light-weight A.I. hard coded into the latest synapical processors from Neura-con therefore allowing for higher power thought processes to operate
without a mobile connection. They claim the improved 'duel system' software has sufficient capability, fault-tolerance, & for medical applications.


A spokesperson from Serapis Inc. said the press release "Alice has shown remarkable performance with handling everyday
subconscious thought with our customers reporting significantly reduced mental strain. Our latest iteration has been aiding those who suffer from
*relevant-mental-disorder*, by *methods-of-treatment*. Those project trials have so far shown a 91% success rate and we'll continue develop the
applications for this kind of treatment to similar illnesses."

But this project maybe far from over with the corporation allegedly developing "Tri-thought" detailed in a partly-leaked presentation for the
annual Consumer Cybernetic Enhancements Expo (aka "two-cee") taking place next week. The slides leaked mention the use of current NET connections to
Serapis with Alice through a user's node for "Deeper Introspection" and "Wider conscious awareness".

As to what that means, we'll have to find out when the company gives it's key-note in Las Vegas later this week.
