"3 hours until window is open"

The ethereal voice said in a tone so neutral it could only have been crafted from silicon.
Even on a biting northern night like this where the winds & rain seemed to cut through any attempt by man to shield themselves by cloth or steel,
and anything with a shred of primal instinct headed natures new-found wrath by remaining sheltered... those in her line of work were
reluctantly active.

The long black outer-coat Vic wore automatically pulled closer against her more revealing undergarments when the wind picked up in an angry gust,
the hood momentarily revealing her long, weathered, jet-black locks and pale complexion before wrenched back into place by unseen powered threads
within the heavy woollen fabric.

"2 miles to contra-a-act loca-ation"

Vic let out an exasperated sigh as the neutral voice stuttered with the same glitch that plagued the aged models of this A.I's module.
"Just one more job... just one more job then you can take your break and enjoy your earnings he said... Just being able to replace this piece of shit
will make this one worth it!"

She weaved in and out of the main thoroughfare crowds, easily disappearing under the sea of umbrellas and moving between the corporate try-hards
rushing home after another 12 hour work-day, dressed-to-the-nine socialites cruising from one party to the next, and the groups of absolutely wankered
red or blue covered football fans.

The former of the two celebrated loudly and the latter found solace at the bottom of a pint glass before promptly smashing it over the opposition's head.

Welcome to Manchester.
