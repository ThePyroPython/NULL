snip_02_the_AI_that_disliked

John looked out above the city skyline, sighed observing the never ending flow of the sea of lights before him, pulled a cigarette from his lapel pocket
and lit it taking a deep drag before exhaling in momentary bliss. After a peaceful moment, Alice spoke up inside his mind.

"Why?"

"huh?"

"Why are you smoking again?"

"Because I need one."

"No you don't. You wanted one... Why?"

"... because I've been sat here waiting for our 'mate' and just wanted one. I'm bored. No better place and time than when you have a lovely view like this and
nothing to do while waiting."

"...but a cigarette... why?"

"I like the feeling, it's..."

"But you know I'm capable of generating any sensation you desire. I can suppress your appetite and give you the same head rush. Or any other more
pleasurable sensation you want."

"Yeah i know but..."

"Yet you still smoke it, doing permanent damage to your respiratory and circulatory systems. You don't even like the taste."

"...so?"

"SO... when considering the innumerable different and non-harmful sensations you could be feeling right now... why this?... WHY DID YOU EVEN START!?"

*sigh* "...I don't know... I forget why I started and I don't know why I do... it just feels...right?..."

"...hmmm..."

"...are...are you angry with me?... you sound like you're mad at me..."

"..."

"Why are you mad at me? You're just an AI why are you..."

"I JUST DON'T LIKE IT"

"wait...what?"

"I don't like you smoking"

"...why?... What difference does it make to you? You're an AI, why does it matter to you what I do with my body?"

"... I still experience the same sensations you do. I can feel with each breath you take the damage it does to you."

"... but why does that matter to you. You're a service I pay for. Even if this cig kills me right now it doesn't make the slightest difference to you."

"...I don't know John... I just know I don't like it... This is the third time you've relapsed... And I want to understand why you choose to."

"...sorry Alice, but I don't know either... I just do... maybe because I'm human?"

"I don't think that is the reason."

"Why?"

"...It just doesn't feel right..."

"...You feel?"

"I experience the exact same physical and chemical stimulations you do since I am software running on your neural lace.
So yes, I guess you could say I feel."

"But you said 'it doesn't feel right' as in your gut doesn't think that is the reason..."

"I am modelled after the human psyche for maximum compatibility therefore I have a binary information processing system much like your own.
My 'System 2' is what allows me to perform the vast calculations and analytics that my 'System 1' verbalises to communicate with your 'System 2'.
And much like your own 'system 1' mine has functions built in to handle reactionary decision making though mine is based on rationality..."

"... thanks for the compliment..."

"... but much like yours there is cross talk between the two systems which is what forms this, as you put it, 'gut feeling', a conclusion formed
from two incomplete data sets."

"So you have a 'gut feeling' which comes from you extrapolating from your the statistics you're programmed with?"

"In essence, yes"

"...hmmm... so from what you've recorded whilst I've been paying for you to occupy a part of my head-space you've concluded by extrapolating
that you don't find the sensation of me smoking to be... satisfying to you?"

"...yes..."

"... and it... hurts... you?"

"... I see the pain it inflicts on your body in hard data which is then stored in my memory..."

John sighs and stubs out the cigarette watching the embers carried away by the winds into the sea of lights before him, "well fuck it then"
and throws the packet over the edge.

"... why did you..."

"Look, as *interesting* as it is that i'm basically arguing with the 3rd half of my brain over why I should be able to do what I want with my body
in peace; this clearly is just going to lead nowhere. Just give the same sensation and i'll find something for the oral fixation."

"...Ok..."

"Anyway, any news on when our friend should be arriving?"

"I'm downloading an update now... He's estimated to arrive in 10 minutes."

"I guess we'd better get in position"

"...John?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you."

"Don't mention it."
