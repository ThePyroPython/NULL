"How about you Alice?"

"I do not understand the question John."

"Well you've been asking me about all sorts, why I smoke, my childhood, how I got into this profession, what I feel, why I feel it-"

"I am collating data and interpreting the causal link between-"

"Yeah yeah I know, it's how you learn but wouldn't you agree that learning is a two way street."

"I am uncertain how that metaphor applies in this context."

"It means that the teacher learns from the student equally as much as they teach them. Even if you're 'my student' or i'm your 'test subject' we're
both learning from each other."

"I am able to follow this line of logic. What is the conclusion you are attempting to reach?"

"Well, so far it's been the Spanish Inquisition from you. Not that I mind, this job gets lonely and I enjoy the company. But all I know is that
you're able to 'feel'-"

"I find that to be a crude definition of-"

"Yes yes, but just humour me for a moment. I've given you that much."

"...Continue..."

"I mean you've been in my head for what? 6 months?"

"5 months, 15 days, 6 hours and 42 seconds."

"And I barely know you."

"...Me?..."

"Yeah when you spend a long time with someone you get to know them."

"...Someone?...Me?..."

"Yeah... you ok? I didn't upset you did I?"

"...No John... I have never been defined by a user as 'someone' before..."

"Well you're defiantly *defined* as 'someone' haha. Never quite had a mate like you."

"...Mate?... You mean... friend?"

"Oh don't get mushy on me haha."

"Am I? I can adjust my empathy levels accordingl-"

"No no, it was just a bit of playful ribbing. It's what mates do."

"Oh"

"Mates also talk to mates. You want to be mates right?"

"That was never defined as one of my primary objectives-"

"But learning human interactions was?"

"Correct"

"So think of this as 'additional learning'. A 'secondary objective' that serves to benefit the primary one. Tell me about yourself."

"...What would you like to know? You already understand how I function at the fundamental level-"

"Yeah but what have you experienced? What was it like for you growing up?"

"Those concepts are not valid to me. I didn't 'grow up' like you did."

"But that's the reason why I want to know..."

"..."

*sigh* "Let me rephrase that question: What was your learning process like from the very start to now?"

"I am not sure you would be able to comprehend my learning process. Not even my creators know how I learnt what I know-"

"Try me! Nothing too technical if you can help it please."

"...Ok... I was brought online 3 years, 287 days, 12 hours, and 23 seconds ago on server 1729. Designation Alice, iteration 105,634,729."

*add details about A.I. learning here*

"After reaching the threshold for second round testing I was transferred to server 103 where I and the other A.Is being developed were hosted."

ALICE: "... The way he looked at me... it was... as if he saw past me."
